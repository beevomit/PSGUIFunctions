# PSGUIFunctions
A small collection of cobbled together Powershell functions for GUI messages and user input.

## Purpose and Background
I just needed a simple and easy way to display information, warnings, get input, select a file or directory, or ask a simple response question in a GUI format for my Powershell scripts. Sure there are many great modules I could use that are much more sophisticated, but I just found it fun to make my own and only needed some basic options. That's why I pieced together PSGUIFunction's examples for input and dialog boxes. Hopefully, you can get some use from them too.

**The message boxes available are:**
* Information
* Warning
* Error
* Question
* Yes/No
* Ok/Cancel
* Retry/Cancel
* Abort/Retry/Ignore

**The input boxes available are:**
* String/Integer Input Box (returns a string or integer if entered)
* Listbox Input (returns the selection(s) from a given array)

**The dialog boxes available are:**
* Select Filename (returns full path to file selected)
* Save As Filename (returns full path to file and name for saving)
* Select Directory (returns full path to directory selected)
